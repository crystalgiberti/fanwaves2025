# VIP Subdomain Deployment Instructions for BlueHost

## Step 1: Create Subdomain in BlueHost cPanel

1. **Log into your BlueHost cPanel**

   - Go to https://my.bluehost.com
   - Click "cPanel"

2. **Navigate to Subdomains**

   - In the "Domains" section, click "Subdomains"

3. **Create New Subdomain**
   - **Subdomain**: `vip`
   - **Domain**: `fanwaves.fun`
   - **Document Root**: `/public_html/vip` (auto-filled)
   - Click "Create"

## Step 2: Upload Files via File Manager

1. **Open File Manager**

   - In cPanel, click "File Manager"
   - Navigate to `/public_html/vip/`

2. **Upload Files**
   - Delete any default files in the `/vip/` folder
   - Upload these files:
     - `index.html` (the VIP form)
     - `.htaccess` (configuration)
     - `robots.txt` (SEO)

## Step 3: Set Permissions

1. **File Permissions**

   - `index.html`: 644
   - `.htaccess`: 644
   - `robots.txt`: 644

2. **Folder Permissions**
   - `/vip/` folder: 755

## Step 4: Test the Subdomain

1. **Wait for Propagation** (5-15 minutes)
2. **Visit**: https://vip.fanwaves.fun
3. **Test Form**: Submit a test request
4. **Verify SSL**: Should automatically redirect to HTTPS

## Step 5: Email Configuration (Optional)

## Troubleshooting:

### If subdomain doesn't work:

1. Check DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org
2. Verify subdomain was created correctly in cPanel
3. Ensure files are in `/public_html/vip/` not `/public_html/vip/vip/`

### If form doesn't submit:

1. The form currently uses a mailto fallback
2. For production, integrate with Formspree or similar service
3. Update the JavaScript submission URL in index.html

### For SSL issues:

1. BlueHost provides free SSL - should auto-activate
2. Force HTTPS in .htaccess (already included)
3. Contact BlueHost support if SSL doesn't activate

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy files** to BlueHost
2. **Test thoroughly** on mobile and desktop
3. **Set up email forwarding** if needed
4. **Monitor form submissions**
5. **Promote VIP portal** to premium customers
